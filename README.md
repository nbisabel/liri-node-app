#LIRI NODE BOT

*This assignment required us to use three major API's to look up information. The three API's were Spotify, Bands in town and OMDB. All 



##Spotify
*This portion of the assignment did prove a little difficult in the sense of getting the right information being used. It took a little bit of time to research mostly because I was having a little trouble on excecuting the right format and structure. Pseudocoding defiinitely helped quite a bit. 


##OMDB
*For OMDB what is being placed in the description was meant to call to the OMDB api through the node file request in order to call the right information from the API. 




##Bands in Town 

*In this portion of LIRI, what we do is call in a requests from the API, while working alongside moment.js in order to shoot out information to the user based on what they had inputed.
